# Week-6-Project
This is a repository for the week 6 project. 
The goal of this repository is to compare English and French texts over the years from 1600 - 1900. 
To run the project there are six main scripts that each give additional information about various poems. 
To determine the frequency of letters in english poems over the years use englishindividualletters.m and to find out the frequency of letters in french poems over the years use frenchindividualletters.m.
To determine the frequency of the top 5 most common two letter combinations over the years in english poems use englishcombinations.m and for french poems use frenchcombinations.m.
To determine the frequency of the top 10 most common words over the years use script_word_freq.m for english poems and for french use script_french_words.m. These call the function word_freq.m so have that one opened. 
There is another way to determine the frequency of the letters using the letter_frequencies.m function and the script_letter.m script. This gives the letter frequencies for the english poems. 
The other way to determine the frequency of the letters in french poems is by using french_letter_frequencies.m function and script_french_letter.m script.
